Argument 1:
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Argument 2:
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Argument 3:
Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?

I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.

I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing.

High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.

It's the popularity of baseball in the days of Babe Ruth that all sports strive to achieve. It is with that type of popularity or attention to one specific thing that brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite pastime, well at least it is my book.

The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.

The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.

Argument 11:
Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

Argument 12:
It is pointless. I see no positive thing about it. It is not the best way to communicate to people seeing at we have phones, email, instant messenger, video calls, and video chats. The apps have no meaning and are really not that fun. I also do not see why anyone would wanna post about their feelings or what their doing and shout it out to everyone. I really do not care if billy bob is going shopping. It is also a place for online and maybe real life stalkers and maybe future stalkers.

Argument 13:
The processes of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. SPICE shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much clearer than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.

Argument 14:
I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.

* The state's hands are kept clean.

* An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.

Argument 15:
I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.

Argument 17:
I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.
To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.

Argument 1:
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Argument 2:
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Argument 3:
Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers.
Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause.
Guess what. if you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?

Argument 5:
Although I believe both baseball and football are both deeply rooted in America's history, I believe that baseball has to America's number one pastime. It's the popularity of baseball in the days of Babe Ruth that all sports strive to achieve. It is with that type of popularity or attention to one specific thing that brings people together. Baseball definitely has to be America's favorite pastime, well at least it is my book.

Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident?
It is things like this that make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all at least in the beginning.

I would be in favor of that. My personal convictions could never allow me to support caging an animal up behind bars for the amusement of people. Animals are meant to be free. Of course nothing like this would ever be taken seriously by a substantial amount of people because for the most part animals are viewed as inferior which then justifies locking them up. F**k zoos.

Argument 8:
The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

Argument 9:
First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?

I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.

Argument 11:
Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

Argument 13:
The processes of the Engineering process category in SPICE are more beneficial for designing or assessing processes of typical projects developing software-intensive systems. SPICE shows the relation of tests to requirements and integration tests to architecture and design much clearer than CMMI. Additionally, SPICE contains a sophisticated list of typical input and output work products with detailed characteristics that greatly supports process development work. CMMI is missing such a systematic approach regarding work products.

I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.

* The state's hands are kept clean.

* An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.

I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.

I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.
To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.

I think ADHD and perhaps some forms of autism aren't a bad thing, but the next level of human evolution. ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.

I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide.

By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.

They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.

If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

Man always has the freedom to do what he wants to do, but not what he should do.
Adam had the choice to do either good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has freedom to do what he wants to to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof.
But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.

I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat because fat and curvy aren't the same thing.

However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.

In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't payed as much as running backs and running backs aren't payed as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being payed more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one?

The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.
To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't payed as much as running backs and running backs aren't payed as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being payed more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

Argument 8:
The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

First of all, very first of all, us people are very greedy. We like to scrimp if we can, so we can pocket the difference. $8B, according to Forbes is its budget. If it was so useless, or even if Congress felt they could get away without it, they would immediately remove it. $8B more! They'd raise their pay! But they don't. Why wouldn't they? Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving. You have seen new security measures every year and while yes, they are annoying, they may have potentially saved your life. How's that for throwing away 500ml of water and standing in queue for 30min?

I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.

Argument 11:
Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't payed as much as running backs and running backs aren't payed as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being payed more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

Argument 49:
No. The suicide (particularly of young people) is not only a drain on the country (education and the like) but also means the loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society. Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.

Argument 1:
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Argument 2:
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities.

Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege."

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business.

It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.

Nothing the US can do with China stood right behind North Korea, any action you take they can counter act.
You just have to hope the Chinese can talk some sense into them. After all, there isn't a more westernised communist nation on the earth than China.
Besides, sanctions only harm the innocent citizens, it does not do much to stop the leaders.
Maybe proving Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer? Who knows.

In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't payed as much as running backs and running backs aren't payed as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being payed more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

In terms of intimate relationships, they are non-existent. I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

Argument 33:
it had a good plot. it was your typical revenge story, but they didn't reveal that until the end. it had a good twist. and underlying it all, it had somewhat of a moral. if you are going to complain about the audio as your reason for it being a bad movie then you need to get off your pretentious pedestal and hang out with the rest of humanity.

Argument 34:
In my opinion, curvy denotes an hourglass figure with with hips, boobs, and butt that stick out. Curvy is healthy body type that people have  naturally. Fat isn't healthy. Curvy women don't fit into the "skinny" category because of their assets, but also aren't an unhealthy weight. I feel that it is inappropriate to call women curvy as a nicer alternative to fat because fat and curvy aren't the same thing. I feel that it is unfair and misleading to actual curvy women for fat women to use the descriptor curvy. That being said I have nothing against someone for being overweight.

EDIT: I want to thank all the people who replied. I do realize that I may not hold the majority view. I should have used the word overweight rather than fat. Humans do require a percentage of body fat to be healthy.

This may vary by country somewhat, but in my country (UK) I see people complain that healthy food is too expensive,  then walk by the £1/1kg bag of carrots (would last several meals as a side), the 80p bag of celery, the £1/1kg bag of oats, the 75p/kg bag of bananas...  several kilos of food here for less than £4. if you have a big enough freezer you can even buy chicken breast in bulk thatll last months (£48/10kg here)...Then buy ready meals at £2 each or worse, buy a £4-7 takeaway (fair enough as a treat but I see people do this several times a week, the same people who complain healthy food is expensive)

Argument 36:
American politicians have turned a blind eye to illegal immigration for too long. Crime is rampant on the border states and illegals are taking our jobs. On top of that our tax money goes to pay for their childrens public education and ER visits. They don't pay into the system but steal from it. Their very status should say it all --illegal--
We need states to become more active in arresting illegals, more troops on the border, a fence, and a revision to citizenship "those who are born here = automatic citizens."

Argument 37:
After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup wasn't signed that is, one partner usually receive alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive them.

If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think.

If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. 

Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job.

I realise that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So I don't really have a definition for greatest and so I guess it's open for interpretation. 

So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). 
The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. 
The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). 
The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. 

I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, &amp;c. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. 

So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.

I don't think its a waste of time but i think it is pointless because our world ( Earth ) Has its own bigger problem like world poverty, population, polution, and the biggest threat...Global Warming. Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak. Scientists could be foucusing on our world problems frist and try to fix those instead of trying to make other planets better to live on. What if we focus on that and near the eand we find out it is impossible to do and everyone will die because of scientist caring to much about other things when there lives also could be in stake

Argument 40:
Ocarina of time is better than Majora's Mask. Both games were fun to play, and MM was a great compliment to OoT, but OoT just stands out on top of MM. We're talking about what most people regard as the best game ever made. OoT successfully brought the Zelda series into the 3D realm, and gave us a massive world to explore and one of the most engrossing stories ever to be found in a video game. OoT was one of my first game addictions, and the game that got me into the Zelda series. Brilliantly designed and executed, and still regarded by many as the best game in the series. All honors need to go to Ocarina of Time.

Argument 41:
I enjoyed his briefing today. It is clear that he understands that he is taking hits by being compared to Bush's Katrina as far as this oil spill goes and understands the Sestak issue will have to be dealt with, whereas before, I don't think he or anyone else took it very seriously. What bothers me is that he took 77,000 from BP, yet directs the corruption between politics and oil companies being the problem. However, that cozy relationship was established long before he got into office. This problem has existed since before Carter was in office, so for him to keep pointing fingers at Bush is irresponsible.

Nothing the US can do with China stood right behind North Korea, any action you take they can counter act.
You just have to hope the Chinese can talk some sense into them. After all, there isn't a more westernised communist nation on the earth than China.
Besides, sanctions only harm the innocent citizens, it does not do much to stop the leaders.
Maybe proving Japan with nuclear weapons would combat North Korea, and act as a buffer? Who knows.

Argument 43:
In the NFL it is safe to say that not every position that is played is created equal. Kickers aren't payed as much as running backs and running backs aren't payed as much as quarterbacks. With that being said, quarterbacks are being payed more because the success of the team depends more on the decisions the quarterback makes. You don't see any successful teams in the NFL just because they have a star safety. More times than not, a team is successful based on the ability of your quarterback. So they should be pampered because of the fact that a teams success rides more on the quarterbacks ability than any other position on the team.

Absolutely. Almost 20 created yesterday (the 12th). The running average in the past few weeks is around 8 or 9 per day.
There should be a maximum posted per day, possibly having someone elses to wait until the following day, either through a filtered bucket or something like that. Give people a chance to read current ones.
Too many debaters are putting time and effort into the current open debates, and then having them fall further down the list, leading to less people reading and responding to them.
(and I know someone will jump at the chance to call this open debate out as 'just another one pushing others down') but I felt this had to be said.

In terms of intimate relationships, they are non-existent. I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I'm not an attractive person by any means, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even, if by some miracle they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies/TV. 

I feel that a person like me isn't really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.

I am not saying all are, there are many with mental or physical health problems, or and extremely bad start in life. However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school.

Scientifically, humans are born with the instincts to reproduce with women. So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determine your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice. CMV

No. The suicide (particularly of young people) is not only a drain on the country (education and the like) but also means the loss of the potential contributions that person could make to society. Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things. I think more work and thought (not just money), should be put into suicide prevention. Suicide is a trajedy we CAN prevent.
