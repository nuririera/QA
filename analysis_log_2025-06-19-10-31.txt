Argument 1:
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Argument 2:
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Argument 3:
Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.

Argument 11:
Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an "out".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.

I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries. High taxes seem to be causing an exodus from certain countries which creates loss of tax income. Places like Dubai and Singapore are benefiting greatly from the tax challenges faced in mature economies. MNC have been doing it for years, individuals are starting as well now.

I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have "at war" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.
Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but with this kind of evidence, I feel there is no question that he was murdered.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.

If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.

Because they think it serves some sort of purpose, and I am assuming it is the one of protecting the USA. Secondly, it is evolving.

3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.

Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of "terrorism" so in theory the "war" would never end since there will always be "terrorism" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities.

Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife.

I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

By "white privilege," I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes.

And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow "deserve it" because of their "white privilege." No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.

Argument 21:
I just don't think its worth it to spend a lifetime of hardship and fear in the real world, constantly wondering when would all come to an end.

I'd rather have a normal life inside the simulation, and of course it could be a terrible and rough lfe, but it could also be a happy life, something that would be very difficult to achieve in the real world.

In the end, we are nothing but souls connected to a life support system (the body). If my soul can achieve happiness through artificial stimulus to my brain rather than "real" experiencess, so be it.

Argument 22:
I've read that America spends three times as much on Special Education students than on normal students in the classroom. I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently.

Argument 23:
I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide.

By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.

They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.

If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

Argument 24:
However, creature comforts and political freedom are still such attractive features to non-Americans that we gain valuable brainpower from countries like India and China every day. There is no doubt that we have our own societal ills, but the US is still at the top of innovation, whereas China, India and even much of Europe can only replicate our inventions, follow in our research, and imitate our military strength.

Argument 25:
Man always has the freedom to do what he wants to do, but not what he should do.
Adam had the choice to do either good or evil. He chose evil. That choice damaged his relationship with God and resulted in an evil world. Now man still has freedom to do what he wants to to do. The problem is that man only wants to rebel and do evil. Look around for proof.
But God has a remedy for the evil. It is Jesus Christ.
Repent and trust in Him.

Argument 26:
Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called "anti-homeless" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base.

Argument 28:
This is influenced by the IAmA submission from the guy who proudly kills fellow human beings in the name of "saving" wildlife. But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings.

Yeah, it is. A religious debate accomplishes nothing. rather insults are passed and one side or the other is seriously ganged against and belittled for their personal beliefs. Nobody will actually change their beliefs because somebody quotes scientific or Biblical 'evidence' that may or may not exist or be a firm as is made sound.
Furthermore, speaking for both sides, both have faults and apparent oppenings of unexplained, so each side will just pick eachother apart as able.

Hoooraaa to the Supreme Court for getting this right. While the ruling did make headlines most people don't understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for ALL.

Karma is spewing out and overflowing and not an original thought has been had. It's bullshit. Can't you people have your own thoughts, or is every concept you grasp dependent on it being intermediated by a career actor mouthing lines that have been signed off by a committee of movie company executives?
