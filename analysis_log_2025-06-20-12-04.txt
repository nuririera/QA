Argument 1:
I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the "danger" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies.

Time for argument 1: 8.72 seconds
Argument 2:
Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing. 
Response: {'cogency': 4, 'effectiveness': 3, 'reasonableness': 5, 'overall': 4}

Time for argument 2: 5.37 seconds
Argument 3:
Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is "evil".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just "assisted" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.
Pick this apart at your will.
Response: {'cogency': 5, 'effectiveness': 4, 'reasonableness': 4, 'overall': 4}

Time for argument 3: 5.21 seconds
Argument 4:
How are you going to enforce it? Stop people in the middle of the road, ask their license and registration, and conduct a breath test? "Sir, you have been randomly selected for breath test, please step outside of the car".
Will certainty give counties jobs for police officers, at the expense of tax payers.
Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause.
Guess what. if you were drinking and cops do not suspect your drinking habits, it is because your Alcoholic content is below DUI. Some cops don't like the extra effort, and paperwork stopping people for DUI. Do you think random testing will solve this problem?
