"Yes, I do believe so. Within in reason, of course. In the earlier stages of life, physical consequence is more receptive to children than verbal scolding. I do not believe that you can label a bad parent if they occasionally hit their children. This method of discipline has been apart of parental doctrine since the beginning of man. It is both effective and, if administered properly, harmless to the child. The argument that the societal acceptance of child spanking condones or escalates child abuse is unsubstantiated. Most cases of child abuse are fueled by unrelated issues involving the parent (ie: alcoholism), not the failure of the parent to exact the correct degree of spankage. Vilifying the proper use of child-spanking condemns good parenting.",2.6666666666666665,2.0,2.333333333333333,2.333333333333333
"*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*

A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.

By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a ""joke"" to those who attend in attire.

Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.

"My reasoning is simple:

- dishwashers require the dishes to be ""pre cleaned"". This already defeats the purpose, why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesn't have food processing capabilities?
- dishwashers rarely removed ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days, and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually.
- dishwashers don't properly dry ""deep"" items like Tupperware and pots, if you aren't careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless.

It will decide a winner, to be sure.

But the better team doesn't always win. 

And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.

The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.

Why not?

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.

It is an unfair, and truthfully a sissy way to decide something so important.

I feel like these people may have ulterior motives or just a different opinion on the perception and actions of situations.

"As a brief intro to this debate, this is not only a debate of the question presented, but of the philosophies behind it. So, for those who don't know much philosophy, just argue about the question. For those of us who know much about philosophy, there will also be a debate within the debate.
I will be arguing that we should kill the one person.
My first regular argument is that even if you don't intentionally let the other people die, by letting them die (not killing the one person) you are still effectively killing them. If you see someone drowning in a lake, and you just watch and laugh, you have effectively just killed them.
My first philosophical argument is that deontology contradicts itself by not respecting human worth. It says everyone has infinite worth, yet we are not respecting the worth of each of the many people if we let them die.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5
"There was a golden age of sorts for Disney where they moved on from the fairly dull and flat movies of the past that started with The Little Mermaid and extended through Beauty and the Beast and Alladin. But then there was lion king.

Even if you hadn't seen or heard of Kimba the White Lion, the Lion King was so predictable as to be cliche. The characters and songs weren't anything more special than any other Disney movie either. 

I believe that the people who prosthelytize about the movie are mostly the ones who watched is as kids or young adults looking through nostalgia colored glasses. People who's first exposure to a real and dramatic story was Lion King so they came to believe that Lion King did something unique or special (when it really, really didn't).",3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.0,3.0
"I think that sports in general are a tremendous waste of time, energy and money and that they are a distraction from the things in our society that truly need our attention. I think far too much effort, manpower and resources, both mental and physical are poured into meaningless feats of strength. These resources could be used to truly change our society for the better. 

The entertainment and camaraderie are a benefit of sports, but I believe that could be achieved on a smaller scale, freeing up massive resources which could be used for the true betterment of mankind. 

Change my view please!

"There should be no ""freedom of religion"" because religion is a false concept- it's like having the freedom to use whatever perpetual motion machine you prefer. Because those are not real, guaranteeing that right is useless and wasteful.

Worse, it subtly legitimizes it. If the constitution really made a point of letting people choose their own perpetual motion machines, many more people would take that idea seriously than otherwise would, to the point where it would seem patriotic to have a preference.

Freedom of religion is not a right anyone should be proud to have. It should be forgotten and ignored, like a clunky relic.

"There are hundreds of states on the planet and all of them engage extensively in initiating aggression against the individuals they control. 

Sometimes state's violence is in response to violence initiated by individuals and then it can be justified. For example – imprisoning a murderer.  

A lot of the time, it is the state that initiates the violence. Yet most people do not see the aggression initiated by the state as problematic. For most people a shop robbery is wrong. But taxation is justified on the basis of a ""social contract"" or other vague concept.

We invent euphemisms to give state action legitimacy. For example we say “drafted” when we could say “slave soldier” or “drug confiscation” when we could say “theft of herbs”. These euphemisms muddy the emotions people feel when they encounter these situations.

After watching the news recently, it really does seem that the cracks in the EU since the recession are starting to get larger because of foreign policy matters with Russia.

- Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some.

To me, what that means is that the government should be readily available to give me an equal chance of protection as if I myself had a gun to neutralize any threats (like armed intruders). Realistically, this means that police need to show up within 10-20 seconds if there is an armed intruder in my home. I think that is enough time for me to survive (via running or hiding) as an unarmed person facing off against an armed intruder.

"The difference between ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" comes down to whether or not one believes a woman should have the option (choice) to terminate her pregnancy. By believing that this choice should be legal, one isn't advocating abortions (as in, they aren't pushing abortions on people or thinking that they're a good act). One can hold the position that abortions are morally bad, yet still believe the choice should be between a woman and her doctor. Likewise, one can be anti-choice yet still advocate for the death penalty, wars of aggression, etc.

"After a marriage ends, if a pre-nup wasn't signed that is, one partner usually receive alimony from the other. I think this is wrong, and selfish of the people who receive them.

If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think.

If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options. 

Obviously if they had kids together the partner should send the person the kids are mostly with child support to help take care of the children, but money just to take care of the adult they didn't want to be with anymore? hell no. They can get a job.

2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors.

Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why:

She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men.

The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. 


Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women.

After extensively following pretty much every new UFO sighting or alien conspiracy I could find I gradually went from being a firm believer to feeling like it's very likely that all alien/ UFO accounts can be explained by hoaxes or unreliable eyewitness testimony.

So many of the most credible seeming sightings end up being debunked as hoaxes. Similarly, so many credible sources of eye-witness testimony, such as the various military personnel in the disclosure project, end up revealing themselves to be pursuing money and or simply lying about their expertise such as Bob Lazar(claimed to work at Area 51).

"I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery.
There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:
1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.
2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.

Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).

I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.

That said, sports are played to be won, not to have a lot of points scored, and this is especially true of soccer.

"Rowing is def. more intensive. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.",3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665
"I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. 

If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking.

He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. 

You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life. 

Change my view.

EDIT: Swearrengen changed my view. Smarts are worthless without motivation and dedication. The will to succeed is a lot more important than just being a smarty-pants.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
"Yes it is...
There are several times ""no"" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic (the example for nerds: the republic in star wars).
But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same.
In both forms the people vote for the person/persons they want to ""rule"" them, the people choose those who agree with them, the only difference is the different countries' way to do it.
For an example:
Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc.
USA chooses 1 president....BUT STILL: The people CHOOSE, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose ""the chosen ones"".",1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667
"Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument.

""Deportation breaks up families""

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. 

"" Texas was Mexico's""

This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status. 

I have  plenty more, but I'll wait until a debate commences.",3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665
"It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought.  Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas.

Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims.  It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition (according to the principle of parsimony).

Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.",4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665
"In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything is society, such as wealth, income, education, and etc are just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They don't exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusion to make our lives content.

"I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Please change my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.",3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665
"I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. 
Now I don't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. 
I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. 
The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning. 
The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status.
All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.

Viewers who loved it, can you CMV?",3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333

"To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. 

I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. 

Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling. ",3.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,2.333333333333333,3.0
