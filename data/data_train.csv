but i still believe that it should be illegal.

"Affirmative Action's purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student's background. Basing this giving on skin color, while providing a change to a perhaps disadvantaged historical stereotype, does not accomplish Affirmative Action's purpose. 
Skin color is a gift, not earned or chosen by a person, but given at birth by parents. Why should this unearned, pre-decided trait determine the scholarship a student receives? 

I believe that all scholarships should be merit-based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill ""race quotas"" to ""diversify the campus"" in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.

"1) A Home

No one should be homeless in this world. Everyone deserves to have a place to call home, no one should be living on the street.

2) Food

Everyone needs food to be able to live. No reason why people should be starving.

3) Healthcare

EVERYONE should receive equal healthcare regardless of their insurance and money situation. No one should be able to buy better healthcare.

4) Education

Everyone should be entitled to getting some sort of education. Im not saying put everyone into college, im just saying that if someone wants to better themselves with education, be it getting a basic high school education, a college degree, or some sort of trade, it should be available.

I honestly hope I do not come across like that. That is not my intention. 

Marilyn Monroe is undeserving of the elegant, classy idol status she has and here is why:

She ruined both her marriages because she slept with other (married) men. 

There are countless reports of her being difficult and unstable in professional situations. 

The biggest reason is because she was a drug addict who died of a drug overdose. 


Now, none of these things make her a bad person (I'm sure the wives of the married men she slept with would disagree with that statement) but she should in no way be considered a role model to women.

Ever since 1999 we have decoded the human genome, and it is time we manipulate it. Our stability as a society has allowed the meek to prosper, not to say that this is bad, but it has proven damning to our condition. We grow ever weaker as we use advanced medication to suffice our ailments to the point that we are not aware of our declination. The only fortitude is in our ability to plan our evolution. If god did not intend us to do so, he is nearsighted. If god wishes us to stop, he is inhumane.

"I did not create this topic, but I would support the decriminalization of marijuana as long as it would still be illegal to sell or advertise it to minors and as long as it is not used while operating automobiles/heavy machinery.
There would be several benefits to legalizing marijuana:
1) People who were arrested for using marijuana would be given a second chance to re-enter the work force.
2) Due to the fact that there will be less prisoners, the taxpayers will pay less to upkeep the prison system.
3) Federal/state governments will gain revenue by taxing marijuana as all goods and services are.
Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand. In result, the value of marijuana increases and the drug industry finds profit in selling it illegally on the black market.

"I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion:
I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.  I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated).  Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).

I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks.

"To keep this a narrowly focused conversation I ask that colleges in large cities be excluded from this discussion. While many universities in major urban areas can provide a similar experience to a ""college town"" considering this factor makes the topic too broad for productive discussion. 
__________________________________________________________

Much like public school, college serves to teach social skills as much as work related skills. Living around a large number of people your age helps you build important social skills and promotes self discovery and development. 

Forced interaction in environments like dorms, fraternities and sororities is  an experience that builds self confidence, self reliance, and valuable experience living independent from parents with people of a similar age. 

Going to a community college or 4 year university with very few students living near/on campus aka commuter campus provides an inferior social education. As such graduates, on average, will be less socially competent than those who went a more traditional 4 year university. ",3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665

"Rowing is def. more intensive. The legs are typically the strongest limbs in the human body. Rowing for distance or time can be extremely taxing on the upper body and core. This argument of course assumes a person has cross-trained for each form of event equally. Not everyone is a natural runner of course but may have insane upper body strength, and vise versa. So it depends person to person. However, for the theoretical all-rounder, I'd have to say rowing.",3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.6666666666666665
"I think that when people talk about privilege, they forget about the most important one. Smarts. 

If you're smart, you can be a wheelchair bound and paralyzed, and still make it in the world. Case in point: Stephen Hawking.

He's got almost nothing going for him other than his brain. He's still successful. 

You could be an African-American/Pacific Islander transgendered/multisex pansexual with chronic diarrhea, paralyzed from the neck down, and a triple amputee with body dysmorphia, but if you've got a 190 IQ, you can become rich. You can be famous. You can have a pretty good spot in life. 

Change my view.

EDIT: Swearrengen changed my view. Smarts are worthless without motivation and dedication. The will to succeed is a lot more important than just being a smarty-pants.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
"Yes it is...
There are several times ""no"" is the correct answer though; dictatorships have called themselves a republic (the example for nerds: the republic in star wars).
But in fact, are Republicans and Democrats the same.
In both forms the people vote for the person/persons they want to ""rule"" them, the people choose those who agree with them, the only difference is the different countries' way to do it.
For an example:
Denmark uses the way where the people (18+) vote for several people who they agree with the most, to become a part of the MPs where the elected people vote for laws etc.
USA chooses 1 president....BUT STILL: The people CHOOSE, and that's where they combine and IS the same, it's the people who vote and choose ""the chosen ones"".",1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667
"Those who are calling for amnesty to be given to illegals have yet provided any rational reasons as to why they should be given citizenship. Here are some of the arguments given and a replies as to why they hold no argument.

""Deportation breaks up families""

Okay, so do incarceration or divorce agreements. Should we end 20 year sentences because inner city children have fathers who were separated from them for committing fraud or theft.

 ""Illegals are the reason why we have cheap vegetables and they do jobs that Americans won't do.""

This argument actually turns against amnesty proponents. Illegals do  unpleasant jobs due to not being eligible to compete for jobs citizens are willing to do. If they receive amnesty, they would opt out of doing the dead end jobs they were paid peanuts to do. 

"" Texas was Mexico's""

This argument is very asinine. This statement makes an argument in terms of territorial acquisition. What illegals want is sovereign status, not territorial status.

"It seems that the fruits of theology are rotten and few; the few theological thinkers that are notable have only produced works of worth under the umbrella of philosophical thought.  Theologians are often poor philosophers, like Aquinas.

Theology is third rate philosophy, as it is merely philosophy with the initial assumption of a specific conception of God/s and scriptural claims.  It is *objectively* less likely to reach true conclusions than philosophy because of this presupposition (according to the principle of parsimony).

Cultural studies, history, anthropology, comparative religion, sociohistory, politics and related subjects form the grounds on which religions may be legitimately and fruitfully discussed.",4.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665
"In a practical sense, our basic needs are pretty much nutrients and water. Everything is society, such as wealth, income, education, and etc are just there to make our lives appear meaningful. They don't exist in the physical world. Hunter and gatherers don't need these social hierarchies to find meaning in their existence. Okay, they may have shorter life expectancy. So what? There's no philosophical explanation on why life has to be long. The fact is that we, civilians, have to create allusion to make our lives content.

"I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me.

"I watched Drive in theaters when it came out several years ago. Almost every single one of my friends absolutely LOVES the movie. The reasons they give are usually as follows: The artistic cinematography, great soundtrack, great acting etc. 
Now I don't hate the movie, but most of my friends said it was one of the best films that came out that year. 
I thought Gosling's character was very bland (yes I know he's supposed to be some sort of sociopath) but I feel like he was nothing more than a pretty face who had violent tendencies. 
The other actors were good, Cranston specifically, but nothing award winning. 
The soundtrack was really good but did little to elevate the movie to 'top 10 movie of the year' status.
All in all I thought it was a boring film (save for the exciting 5 minute opening sequence) that kind of just went nowhere.

"To clarify, I don't believe the World's climate is static and unchanging, I just don't think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven't for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. 

I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can't comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change 'denialists' are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. 

Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling. ",3.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,2.333333333333333,3.0
