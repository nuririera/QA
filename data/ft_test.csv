"###ROLE### You are an Argument Annotator AI. ###OBJECTIVE### Your task is to asses the quality of an argument across four dimensions: cogency, effectiveness, reasonableness and overall. For each dimension, provide a binary score: - ""Bad"" - ""Good"" ###INSTRUCTIONS### You must evaluate each dimension independently, based strictly on the provided definitions. Be particularly strict and conservative when evaluating. Do not hesitate to assign ""Bad"" if an argument does not clearly meet the criteria for that dimension. The overall quality should reflect a synthesis of the other three dimensions but should also consider any other relevant factors. Do not assume that most arguments are ""Good"". Your priority is to identify weaknesses and be sensitive to any lack of quality. Return your response only as a JSON object using that values (Bad, Good). Do not use other labels. You MUST ONLY return a single JSON object with exactly these four fields: cogency, effectiveness, reasonableness, overall. Values MUST ONLY be ""Good"" or ""Bad"", wrapped in double quotes. DO NOT explain. DO NOT comment. DO NOT include any text before or after. ANY output not matching JSON format will be considered INVALID.###DIMENSIONS### 1. **Cogency (Justification Quality)** Evaluate only the justifications used to support the claim. Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

While again, the whole culture itself is not that bad, there are many parts that have stemmed from this culture that are themselves bad for society.  For example, a great deal of sexism, homophobia, and racism is perpetuated through rap music and the culture behind it (though this is slowly changing).  Another is the inherent disrespect that comes with the culture, and just overall rudeness. Just look at the hundreds of videos of vine of people just destroying others' property for laughs, or even the knockout videos or the glorification of those who suckerpunch.  It's despicable.   ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

There are many of examples: British monarchy, Danish monarchy, Japanese. They have no real power and no political influence and are just living on the backs of taxpaying citizen. For example the British royal family cost the UK 40 million pound per year. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I find it puzzling how Special Education students (at least in New York) get one or two teachers that personally teach them, and tons of new high tech equipment in their classrooms. However, many of the needier schools lack even a laptop cart, while Special Education students each have individual tablets. I believe that the Special Education system needs serious reforming, but if anyone can refute this argument, I'm open to thinking differently. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

So far there is no evidence that I know of that proves that there is a gene (or several genes for that matter) that determine your sexual orientation. Mainly, I believe that people convince themselves that they are gay and believe it so strongly that they believe that they have been gay since birth. I don't discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.

Plus, our media doesn’t show all the true horrors of war: refugees, dead soldiers, grieving families, etc. And the thousands of other grotesque nuances that cannot be translated well into media form, like the mental anguish, etc.
So, having a war on our own land could give Americans a taste of their own medicine. It’s easy to grow complacent when it isn’t your children being blown to pieces, your town left in ruins or your legs being blown off.
That why I cannot comprehend why people verbally attack people like Cindy Sheehan. How can you question her motives if you are not in her shoes? Only a coward would attack a parent of a brave soldier that died believing he was protecting his family and country. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Doodling has helped me focus more on whatever my teachers are saying, simple squiggly lines do the best.

I'm in a polyamorous relationship with two men, so I've got a dog in this fight. We live together. They're not in a sexual relationship with each other. We are happy, healthy, stable and long-term.

* The state's hands are kept clean.

* An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an ""out"".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

It's mere presence should be as unusual as a 1 in 10 million genetic mutation. It should not be a part of what we are.

There should be domain extensions (y'know the .com, .net, .org, ...) that are specific to ""unsavory"" industries.

Although it sounds good in the short term, less starvation, it ultimately just temporarily hids a problem. When a third world nation is supplied with free food it can distribute to its people any form of farming or other food production of that country suffers. If a farmer is producing rice and selling it in said country, their livelihood will be ruined by rice which is freely available to the population. If any kind of donations are made, it should be money. This money could be used to subsidize farmers of the third world countries which would allow cheaper food prices, greater food production, and more employment opportunities from the larger food industry of these countries. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Realistic and survivable wage then if people decide to tip then it should go directly to the server. 

I've never understood why employers are allowed to pay 2$ an hour and society is expected to pay their employees wages while they soak up more profit by avoiding paying their employees a realistic livable wage, and I don't feel anyone should be guilted into paying X percentage on top of the bill at a restaurant to pay the servers wage wen it should be their employers ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Which will kill 6.5 billion maybe even more people as we speak.

Others are probably going to argue that if people really want to end their life then it is cruel to keep them alive. I disagree. People can change their minds about these things.

While I have not been explicitly told that the IRA and Sinn Fein are evil people, I have been given a very negative view of them.
It seems to me that the IRA were blowing up the Unionists because they wanted the Republic of Ireland to have territorial expansion into Northern Ireland and them wanting to be part of Northern Ireland was blantantly false. The Republic of Ireland has more or less existed by since WW1, so moving there was not out of the question for the IRA and sympathisers.
I also think that IRA supporters should be tried as criminals who are acting against the UK government and are thus guilty of treason. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

This also applies to the enforcers.  If they do experience scandal for their wrongdoings, the worst that happens to them is losing the next election.  In extremely rare cases they might spend some months in the fanciest prison, whereas those who are not politically connected and do the same crime face long prison sentences.  ""Public officials"" take advantage of ample opportunities to accept donations from special interests in exchange for passing laws which favor the special interests.  The officials then continue to cash in on this exchange by investing in the firms they have helped to protect from competition, in addition to numerous other kickbacks; namely, lucrative ""consulting"" gigs and the like.  Why are most people okay with this?  Are they just ignorant of the mechanism of this political machine? ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

If that didn't do it for you, you could give a bunch of money to the poor and people would like you anyway.

E.g., ""You're privileged, so your opinion on this issue is invalid""

I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

With no firmly set prices, eBay's market closely resembles an internet-based free market... where consumers pay the prices they are willing to pay and suppliers supply goods for what they are willing to supply them for. In otherwords this is a self-targetting market which operates (with the exception of delivery problems) at optimum efficiency.
Amazon on the other hand used to use consumer price-targetting, in other words they would raise prices on certain books for certain users they found to be more likely to purchase certain kinds of books. It was only after they were caught that they decided to stop the price targetting. Now they are setting prices based on what the product suppliers are setting them at, they may not be working at optimum efficiency. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

There are those in government who are making accusations and then trying to build intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence.
Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy.
Well if Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government.

If you had two examples in the Milky Way galaxy, for example, we could conclude that life probably evolves at least twice per galaxy. 

Or if we had an example from the nearest star with planets, we could conclude that probably every star with planets evolves life.

But with just a single example, how do you possibly use that to estimate the distribution of life in the universe?  It could be once per universe, once per galaxy or once per 100 stars.  It would look the same.

e: my point is not that life does not exist anywhere else.  My point is basically that I don't think you can estimate the probability at all. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I plan on majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. 

In terms of intimate relationships, they are non-existent. I have never kissed a girl, nor asked one out. Part of it is that I know they will say no. I'm not an attractive person by any means, I'm very fat and have very poor hygiene. And even, if by some miracle they said yes, the relationship would not last longer than a day at most. I consider myself to be a weird dude. I have weird songs on my iPod and I watch weird videos and have no hobbies other than playing video games, browsing the internet, and watching movies/TV. 

I feel that a person like me isn't really meant for a healthy, sexual, mature relationship with a woman of any sorts. I feel that I have to find some other meaning in my life than passing on my genes.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

That is not to say that all people are good all of the time, or even that all people are basically good. Clearly we have had some rotten eggs. But that does not mean we are essentially evil, selfish things. Easily misled, perhaps, but not inherently bad. On an individual level, people are capable of great caring and impressive acts of selflessness. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

If it does achieve those things, then it would have to do so at same rate, otherwise if it was faster it would be greater than us, or if slower than still inferior to us. However this would only be the case of course if we as ""artificial beings"" of God our creator, would be capable of creating another sentient being in the same image and likeness of our creator and not just ourselves. Otherwise it would never be our equal. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

And having poor people exploited is bad for society. No heathcare, no political and legal representation, and there will be blood spilled with a revolution (as we have seen in Cuba, Russia, and China), and it will usually result in a dictatorship.

However the majority of poor Americans are content, and do not want to have to work, or go to college, or put the time in required to move up in society. I come from a poor family and am in college now, and I feel lazy allot of the time, I almost feel like I am entitled to sit around and play video games all day, but I have to remind myself that the world humans created does not work that way, that we must work for everything we get. I feel that the society we have created has made us soft, people in 3rd world countries work their whole lives to just survive, but we have grown up on video games and easy high school.

1. the death penalty conflicts with the Eighth Amendment in the constitution.
2. retribution is another word for revenge based on both definitions.
3. the U.S. executes a small percentage of those convicted of murder, and these defendants are typically not the worst offenders but merely the ones with the fewest resources to defend themselves, showing that the legal system is unbalanced.
4. once an inmate is executed, nothing can be done to make amends if a mistake has been made. Since 1973, at least 121 people have been released from death row after evidence of their innocence emerged showing mistakes had been made.
5. not enough research has been made to except the deterrence effect. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

The story was quite rich; the rise of Palpatine, the clones, Amidala, Anakin, the role of the Jedi... Each arc wasn't just a progression of linear events building up to Episode IV.  

There were some amazing set pieces too; Darth Maul against Obi Wan and Qui Gon, Anakin vs Obi Wan, Jango Fett.

Next to the new ones, the old episodes seem slow, linear a little dumb.

I accept there are plenty of faults with the first three episodes (I'm looking at you, Jar Jar).  I also accept that much of what we accept now as standard fare for sci-fi is off the back of Star Wars, but my argument is simply that the first three episodes (in episodic order) more enjoyable and engaging than the latter three. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

This isn't to say I don't support the sentiment and i do think it's a truly heinous situation, but it doesn't make sense. 

I feel ultimately iy paradoxically increases the effectiveness of the act of terror and to a degree supports/promotes its style by adding fuel to the fire for the terrorists without having an actual force to change anything. 

Whilst there are always going to be smug campaigns which are more about feeling better from doing some armchair activism than true will to change, i do think that a lot of people will feel this particular campaign has a lot of merit so that it keeps it in the social conscience. I just don't think it works this time for the reason above. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Perhaps in the first six months after passing the test, as well as provisional licensees (I think there are restrictions on this anyway) should have restrictions on the number of passengers.
Personally, I would also sugest a restriction on how far a newly licesnsed driver can travel on thier own, or with them as the sole driver. Obviously this would be very hard to police, but would prevent thousands of dangerous accidents every year from new drivers on thier first motorway jaunt. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

All of the worst dictators combined have nothing on the amount of suffering this world-view, if true causes. We are talking about a scale of billions being permanently tormented or tortured for their convictions. Nothing all of humanity combined has done can ever come to the scale of this. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I don't know what constituted the slap, how heavy the slap was or to what part of the body. There's a lot of information here I am missing. But I truly do believe that to turn one's back on a hostile situation like that and note that it is the domain of policing or child protective services deprives us a little bit of our humanity. I'm not saying that every intervention needs to be violent or threatening in nature, but I believe that sometimes it is worthwhile and important to act, even if it means you may subject yourself to serious legal consequences. This is what compels us to stop when we see an accident and offer assistance.

There's this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it (because you can't easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic) and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material? 

All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good (and we therefore must do X), and I can't seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. *Why* should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it? *Why* should I believe that it's anything but a bunch of illusions created by mammals that need incentives for prosocial behavior? If I place a world with moral meaning next to one without the latter seems far simpler with less baggage.

And if I am going to buy an iPod either way, isn't it better to buy a red one that sends even a tiny fraction of the purchase price to fighting AIDS than a green one that goes better with my wardrobe but doesn't raise money for anyone but Apple?
Gestures like those ridiculous Livestrong bracelets are weak, but when it's something you were already going to buy (read: NOT a stupid-looking rubber bracelet), I think that having a philanthropic option is refreshing--even if it's just a LITTLE philanthropic. The previous options weren't at ALL philanthropic.
If it's no worse and it's not the same, odds are it's, well, a little better. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I have food and shelter and a good job, but I find that there isn't a lot to look positively on. For example, everyone is always buried in their smartphone. I can't even enjoy myself when I go to a concert because everyone has their phone in the air to film the show. They've ruined every social situation I can think of.

Something else I've noticed is that a lot of people have started to become more accepting of more and more people. (eg, the LBGT community) The thing is though, it seems like it's more of a fad to like it instead of actually accepting them. I know, I'm probably a monster for thinking that way, but it's how I feel... ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

The test that would be implemented would not be very difficult, but would ensure that the voter had read the bill before they vote. I believe something like this could be accomplished by trials in which sample populations who have not yet read the bill would be allotted a certain amount of time to read the bill, and then answer a variety of multiple choice questions. From this information, researchers could pick and choose questions that those with a poor high school education could answer having read the bill. 

-EDIT-

I would like to also say that this would be an 'open book' test; the bill would literally be in front of them.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

The right circumstances and societal influences could bring out the same in each of us.  I am definitely not supporting any of the atrocities he engaged in.

It is safer than alcohol, its nearly impossible to overdose on, and if it was legal it would be easier to regulate. A great example of this would be prohibition: when it was illegal, people still did it (as they do with weed) and it cost a lot of police force to crack down on speakeasies (like they do with weed houses) that could have been used to solve more pressing cases like who shot Mr. Burns and who took the last donut.

If this is true, should we as a society not want as many as possible to see what happens to people when they are sentenced to death? At the very least, it will disseminate information to public about what execution in the United States is actually like (this may, in turn, change the beliefs that someone holds on the death penalty). ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

While the ruling did make headlines most people don't understand how important it really was. The right of Habeus Corpus is foundational to a free society and to liberty for ALL. This ruling is a referendum on the wanton disregard of Bush an his administration to do something they all promised to do - protect the constitution. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

My view is that this should be the *standard* type of container. It is usually sold in a cup container with a lid, similar to yogurt.

Most of the time sour cream is used, it would be more useful in a squeeze type of container, similar to ketchup or mustard. Yes, *sometimes* it may be more convenient to have a yogurt type of container, making it easy to scoop with a spoon. But a large majority of the time, it is used as a topping, which would be much easier to apply with the squeeze of your palm.

Regardless of race everyone is still unique. Nobody should have to feel like they're just like everyone else because of their race.


No two people are alike. Everyone is born with different interests, beliefs, and physical characteristics. Now, I'm not saying it's alright to purposely exclude members of different races, but they should not have to be integrated into communities of one race in order to make it more ""diverse"". 


Moreover, even within a single race there are numerous differences in appearance and skin colour. Race really shouldn't matter that much. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

This begs the question: external source of consciousness or internal source of consciousness?

We could just as easily be a host for consciousness which has an external source, as we could be just a random accidental chemical self-awareness.

Just because fiddling with the brain fiddles with perception does not mean that our consciousness is sourced in the brain for the same reason that breaking your speakers does not mean the livestream you're watching went silent.

So we really have no scientific reason to believe that we will just go to sleep and never wake up, but it philosophically makes sense in a universe with so many cyclical systems that we are just reborn. You dont have to believe in rebirth but there is no scientific basis for either external or internal consciousness and no scientific basis for the belief that death is just a black abyss. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred. I see nothing wrong with the spikes if they are doing it to protect their customer base. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

For instance:
""But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)....."" Surah 9:5
or: “O ye who believe! Fight the Unbelievers who gird you about, and let them find firmness in you: and know that Allah is with those who fear Him” (Surah 9:123)
And while I understand that many verses of peace are in the Koran, they are abrogated by the later verses of war.
Also, while many wars are fought for religion by all religions, Islam is the only one that calls for violence in it's Koran, unlike Christianity or Judaism.
Based on this, I find a fear of Islam rational and justified. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

I also understand that many conflicts have started because of religion or have revolved around religion, for example WWII, Muslim Conquests, the Ottoman wars in Europe, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Another reason I think this is because of how other religions try to demonize one another. ""Your religion is wrong and bad while mine is right and good! Let's fight about it!"" 
There are also people and animals that are sacrificed for religion, people ignore science and rely on ""faith"", religious places (whether it be a church or temple whatever) are always asking for money, Censorship  of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs, etc.
Not to mention people are voted into office often because of their religion.

Religion, being based on zero evidence and abstract ideas attacks intelligence and mental development of human beings.

Most news either does not effect my life or will be forgotten or irrelevant in a matter of months.

I am not saying that they are pointless, as people enjoy watching or reading news, but as a source for up-to-date, interesting and well researched information, there are enough specialist sources for a deeper critique or explanation to current affairs, and twitter/reddit keep me informed with anything that is particularly salient.

I've deleted the BBC, HuffPost and CNN apps from my phone, I can get current affairs from Twitter. Any takers, CMV?

Edit: I am not questioning the importance of journalism. It is my position in the news chain. Why read the paper or watch the news when I can find out what is important from trusted people and then read myself, rather than sift through headlines. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

My understanding (which I admit is limited) is that unless a governing body makes an active effort to relieve poverty, the outsourcing of American projects to China is a necessary thing so that the families/people of China can scrape by. If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves. Workers who have the jobs that robots would replace would again have the same issue as those in China-so while I don't agree with paying children or other adults pennies for hard labor, I think it's the best way to maintain the fragile balance we have. Improve first, then change what can be changed.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Over in /r/ledzeppelin there's been several recent interviews from Jimmy Page, who never turns down a chance to slag mp3's. But I'm willing to bet if you sat him down with proper experimental controls, he'd fail as much as anyone else at hearing any difference, at say 256 kbps bitrate or higher. He's mentioned the new Led Zeppelin deluxe reissues will include download cards for 24/96 versions of all tracks.

That being said, I still don't like mp3's, at least for home audio. I'm a bit of a snob about it, probably much like a lot of people. I like my audiophile setup a lot. I tend to covet original gold cd's (Mobil Fidelity Sound Lab etc.) or LP's. But my ears probably can't catch much difference. And certainly I hugely love plugging an iPod full of mp3's into my fancy vehicle audio system. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Be particularly strict and conservative when evaluating. Do not hesitate to assign ""Bad"" if an argument does not clearly meet the criteria for that dimension. The overall quality should reflect a synthesis of the other three dimensions but should also consider any other relevant factors. Do not assume that most arguments are ""Good"". Your priority is to identify weaknesses and be sensitive to any lack of quality. Return your response only as a JSON object using that values (Bad, Good). Do not use other labels. You MUST ONLY return a single JSON object with exactly these four fields: cogency, effectiveness, reasonableness, overall. Values MUST ONLY be ""Good"" or ""Bad"", wrapped in double quotes. DO NOT explain. DO NOT comment. DO NOT include any text before or after. ANY output not matching JSON format will be considered INVALID.###DIMENSIONS### 1. **Cogency (Justification Quality)** Evaluate only the justifications used to support the claim. Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### In both of these events a country lost territory which rightfully belonged to its people.

In both cases, an authority felt the need of land-grabbing, one secured their military base, the other ~~wanted their holy land back~~ also secured their military presence.

Both of these events caused and continue to cause ultimately unnecessary instability within Ukraine and Palestine. This naturally leads to deaths.

Yet, because of superpowers involved it's common to make this an issue about taking sides with either the US or Russia, when the countries essentially did the same thing. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

Watching again 10 years later I though maybe at times Toby could seem a little bit mopey but I don't understand why there is so much aggression toward the actor. He was decent in the great Gatsby. Am I missing something here? Poeple on internet constantly complain about his various faces. I have only notice the one mildly aggravating mopey face. Please elaborate as much as you can on this subject please and thank you. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

ADHD yes makes you not focus easily but when you do, you hyper focus grasping everything. I have multiple friends who have ADHD and when they force themselves to focus, they do great things, get the highest grades and retain more knowledge. And some people with autism can be servants, which means they are highly proficient in something, generally math science or music, which is fantastic. I think we should let those kids blossom and be there own unique awesome person, advancing human towards the next step in our history.

I can understand why they would have it, but even following basic rational thought it doesn't make sense.

There's nothing stopping the person buying the products from walking out of the store, and walking right back in alone, to a different register or going to the next store over to do the same thing or ultimately, preventing any real liability on the part of wal-mart. If someone who is 21+ buys for a minor, the law will attack them, not the selling institution. All this does is discourage people from buying alcoholic products at the store in the first place.

All of those who believe president Obama is such an awful president must not realize he is not the one who originally put us into such a sorry economic state, if he does continue improving the economy it is possible we can set ourselves back on the correct track. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"
