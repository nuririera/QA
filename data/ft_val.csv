For each dimension, provide a binary score: - ""Bad"" - ""Good"" ###INSTRUCTIONS### You must evaluate each dimension independently, based strictly on the provided definitions. Be particularly strict and conservative when evaluating. Do not hesitate to assign ""Bad"" if an argument does not clearly meet the criteria for that dimension. The overall quality should reflect a synthesis of the other three dimensions but should also consider any other relevant factors. Do not assume that most arguments are ""Good"". Your priority is to identify weaknesses and be sensitive to any lack of quality. Return your response only as a JSON object using that values (Bad, Good). Do not use other labels.

DO NOT explain. DO NOT comment. DO NOT include any text before or after. ANY output not matching JSON format will be considered INVALID.###DIMENSIONS### 1. **Cogency (Justification Quality)** Evaluate only the justifications used to support the claim. Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### After finishing Reservoir Dogs for the first time last night, I have noticed how much of a bullshit move this is. I have heard the usual reasoning and still find no logic in it. They are doing us a service that does not have to be provided to us. They work hard and they usually only get paid enough that it pays for the state and federal taxes applied to the wages. To not tip our servers is a like a slap in the face to them. They rate their performance on how big or small their tips are. Be brutal, kind, or what you want. Just be logical ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

I contend such rights are simply constructs, and have no basis beyond any other construct humanity has created.

While there can be some appeal to human nature, nearly all universal behaviour that could be classified as rights only apply to the ""in-group"" and certainly none seem to apply to humanity as a whole. The extension of rights to cover everyone a construct, and not part of fundamental human nature. This is why law exists in general. It's an extension of tribal self-rule for larger groups.

There is certainly nothing about the nature of reality that causes rights to exist. I'd like to hear some good arguments as to why rights are not constructs. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I meant grandparents, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. (Not brothers / sisters either, only child)

Most of my parent's argument is that my family won't be around forever and that they would do anything for me. The thing is, I don't care that they would. I feel it's similar to having some random almost-stranger say they would do anything for you. Just because said random stranger would do anything for me doesn't mean I like them or I need to care about them. I don't want them to help me. I don't need them to help me. They expect me to love this random stranger because this random stranger would do things for me. This random stranger means nothing to me and I find them annoying and rude. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Wouldn't the Christian God, being a jealous god, have made himself known earlier than he did? If he's not really jealous, that still leaves the question of why he let man wonder around so long worshiping ""false gods"". Doesn't this provide reason to doubt all religions? How do we know that the earliest gods who were worshiped, aren't sitting ""up there"" seriously ticked off? Pissed that we are claiming each of their individual hard efforts to make us and the world we live in is actually the effort of one god? Pissed, that after explicitly putting their word forth, we strayed and worshiped false idols? ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Men who very wealthy and famous, nevermind if they are also younger and decent-to-good looking, have too much temptation to have sex with other women. They dont even need any game to get sex. Its too easy. Too easy=too much temptation. I believe that less than 50% of men are strong enough to resist this. Of course, there is no actual data to support this, so this may be a crappy CMV.

Therefore, when the wives/gfs of these men are taken by surprise, they are being irrational. Its more likely than not that your partner will cheat on you.

For this reason, i believe that women such as Tiger Woods ex-wife were being delusional when they married with the expectation of no infidelity. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

This is seen in the hospital, where respirators, kidney dialysis machines and defibrillator devices are used to keep people alive, save them when they are on the brink of death. Further more, hand phones, cars, mp3 players and the infamous PSP that we see thousands of children, teens and adults playing as well clearly show us mankind's huge dependence on machines. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

Going to college costs money, if they are good enough and maintain a gpa they receive scholarships which are essentially debt relief. There is no difference between cashing a check for $1000 an using it to pay a credit card and a scholarship for $1000. The question here then, is not whether or not college athletes get paid, but should college sports be for profit? If it is a state school the answer is automatically no. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

On top of the religious aspect, I think we shouldn't have it sung in schools period.
School is meant to be an objective learning atmosphere. Introducing peer-reinforced (bandwagon effect due to surrounding peers) patriotism and religious bias has no place in an environment meant to accomodate students of all backgrounds and religions. To me, looking back at my early school days, it seems a little like indoctrination.
So I support at the very least removing religious references in order to accomodate all religous beliefs.
The only way to do that is to have a secular PoA (I don't support any athiestic references either btw :P) .
Further, I think Issues of patriotism should be left to students and their parents outside of school. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

About 3 weeks ago my bike got stolen. I bought a new one, and last night it was stolen as well.

I'm very pissed now. There's no way I'm throwing another 80+ euros to buy a new one at a shop. I also refuse to buy a cheap one which was obviously theft, no way I'm financing those fucking cunts. It looks like the best option remaining is starting stealing bikes on my own.

Why should I not do that? Also please throw in a better alternative. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

So I don't really have a definition for greatest and so I guess it's open for interpretation. 

So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). 
The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. 
The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). 
The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. 

I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, &amp;c. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best. 

So who is it? The UK? China? Make your case.

Both sides of the arguement (christians and muslims) are using the debate as a way to integrate more religious power within the country. This is why the archbishop of Canterbury decided to support the integration. Once islam is allowed to run a parallel law system within Britian there would be nothing keeping christianity from running a parallel law system. Its the classic situation that many parents face; you can't give to one child and not expect the other to want the same thing. Eventually there would be a whole spectrum of different law systems in Britian, which is both illegal and totally unneccesary. If a muslim wishes to be tried under Sharia law they can move to a country that has it as their primary law system. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident?
It is things like this that make me wonder how we can't all believe in a supreme creator whether it be God, Allah, Vishnu, or any other god that people choose to worship. It just seems that somebody/something had to design it all at least in the beginning. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of ""terrorism"" so in theory the ""war"" would never end since there will always be ""terrorism"" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.
To me, it just seems like a huge scam into spending an enormous amount of money on exactly what Eisenhower warned us about. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I've always thought that killing an animal for the right purpose, food and not fun, is morally right because there animals don't understand death, like a human does. They will have the same wonderful life, in the wild, even if I kill it or not.. 
As for producing animals, in order for food, I also think this is ok as long as the animals are treated right, and fair. 

That's why i'm a vegan right now, because I hate how the main meat sources we have come from horrible people who treat animals with un needed cruelty, or atleast it seems like they do.

Edit: What i'm also asking is, is it wrong to actually eat meat from these factories? People make it seem like it's horrible, but I just don't know.

Any pro and con arguments would help me out a lot, thanks! ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

I find everyone in Canada tries to hold onto their culture and wave a flag signifying their bloodline and heritage. I thought this was a good thing and clung onto it myself for a time but discovered I don’t need to define myself by a single (or two or three) nationality/nationalities.

From what I have seen, particularly with people who have moved from their mother country and settled permanently elsewhere, it only seems to lead to bigotry and a stagnation of one's own cultural and personal development. To be Serbian or Croatian or Indian or Saudi Arabian or whatever seems to be interpreted as boldly representing the country’s main religion, beliefs, traditions, etc. at the time that the person left that country. 

Why can’t we accept our differences and that we as people have a developing cultural identity, and not see this as “losing” our identity? The fear of losing this causes people to ignorant and bigoted. CMV

Often it is used so unsubtly that it just reflects lack of effort from the director and it seems as if they are just trying to fit the scream into the film somewhere with no regard to what effect this has on the film. 

I understand that it is an ""in-joke"" but I believe that it is too widely recognized to be used any more without the audience acknowledging it. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

We know that these things are going to happen. So what is the point of being motivated to do anything? Why should I work a terrible job that I have no interest in? Why should I bother to keep in touch with people? I am in a position right now where I am between jobs, and in a general transition phase in my life. Dealing with societal strife is meaningless. I should just withdraw from society and live out my days surrounded by cats or something.

To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow ""deserve it"" because of their ""white privilege."" No one gets to choose their upbringing, good or bad. Treating anyone differently, black or white, because of what their ancestors did is just wrong.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Isn't it bad enough that the year supposedly starts in the middle of winter, so that each year gets TWO winters? Why would we want to split up our weekend so that it's only one day long on each end? A work-week is five days, then two days of play; lather, rinse, and repeat. Or take the ""week"" off and go skiing, but that's neither here nor there.

There is nothing to be done for these people.

For this view, I'm simply looking at Type I diabetics. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is a type I diabetic, so 3 million people. Without an industrial system to make the insulin they need, they will all be dead within days or weeks. It is impossible to manufacture insulin outside of the industrial system. The history of type I diabetics before the modern times has been that they simply die as they slip into a diabetic coma.

Is there any way to manufacture insulin outside of an industrial system? If not, then I think 3 million type I diabetics will be dead within weeks of a total industrial collapse. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Surely it would be more sensible if every few years elections were held where academic experts in each relevant field (each nominated by one party) competed for the position?

The current system where a career politician can go from being a local MP, to being in charge of the entire Education system then suddenly switch jobs and be in charge of the nations Healthcare the next week makes absolutely no sense to me - CMV.

But really? How are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters? Hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence. Hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit. Anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself. One, it does not make the existence of mankind better. Two, it doesn't stop the extinction of various species in wildlife at the hands of human beings. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

The graphics are actually superb and obviously more realistic (being based in a much mearer future with less technological assumptions made).
The game play is completely engrossing and presents a fairly open playing feild to noobies alongside more experienced players.
The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc.
And GOW was simply over hyped and doesn't present the same replay value to me that GRAW does. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.

They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.

If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

This situation assumes the second party did not tamper with the firsts drink or, in any way, use the situation to his or her advantage maliciously (e.g. getting him or her drunk for the purpose of sexual intercourse)

But why for example are we tolerating dictators when the past showed how awful Hitler was and how he abused his political power?

The only thing we are learning is how it was in the past; it might be interesting but it's unnecessary for the further improvement of our life and society.
The only thing I see people with a degree in historical studies doing, is teaching younger persons or writing historical texts.
I don't understand why it's so highly regarded altough it's all for our enjoyment. I don't think it should be called as an subject in scientific discipline. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

While I appreciate people make mistakes, I believe some actions should have permanent consequences, and that we have morally compromised ourselves in making exceptions to this.  I fundamentally contradict that every individual has a right to live- if you are willing to put someone else right to life in jeopardy, then you have demonstrated that you are a net negative impact to society, and that as a whole we would all be better off if you were dead.  

Edited for nuance- you guys have made some good examples of grey areas- I'm not disputing that.  This is more a question of the principle.  Let's go ahead and refine this further- in the moment of endangering another individuals life, with out extenuating circumstances such as mental illness or protecting others, then in that moment society has a prerogative to take your life.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.

In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?

Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages.

The Cold War for example. If the US and the Soviets didn't have their nuclear arsenal, what reason would Stalin, Khrushchev, etc have for NOT invading the rest of Europe? They could've easily done so and not much the US could've done to stop them. 

Our greatest and most terrifying weapons are pretty much our salvation and force us to cooperate even if we don't like each other.  ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

Explicit:
""Describing or representing sexual activity in a graphic fashion""

I have seen far too many books be challenged or banned because it was ""pornographic"" when the text is not sexy or titilating - just descriptive [sexually explicit if you will]. Some dont even include real descriptions of sex at all...

I cannot find a citation right now [on mobile], but i have heard many people say that pornographic is to be defined by the community

Without an understanding of the difference between pornographic and sexually explicit, community members are not at liberty to define either term.

TLDR: If the community doesnt know what theyre talking about they shouldnt get to define words with such harsh connotations ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

I feel that having to present a photo ID to prove you are the person you claim to be voting as, and to prove you are in fact of legal voting age is a fair requirement.  Anything else that you legally have to be certain age for(car rental, drinking, clubbing, driving, traveling on an airplane, etc.) requires ID so why not something as important as voting.  Then there are even some that call it discriminatory even going as far as comparing voter ID laws to Jim Crowe laws.  I feel that it only discriminates against people who have bad priorities(IE someone who registers to vote, but doesn't feel the need to get actual Identification.)

Please change my view.  Thank you. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I feel that companies who use cartoon or clown characters as part of their marketing strategy to kids are unethical. They establish an early link in developing impressionable minds that these products are fun and safe. When a person reaches adulthood, the link becomes permanent -- and they still consume these products out of a sense of childhood nostalgia. I'm open to the idea that there might be flaws in my logic here. So please come and change my view!

Why is one acceptable but the other not?

A bullet wound to the abdomen can cause intestinal agony for months, which seems on par with mustard gas.   If infection sets in, possibly worse.

Having your limbs blown off while you are conscious is probably worse than being gassed.  Being burned by the flames from an explosion is probably on par with mustard gas burns.

Assume that mustard gas is only used on the battlefield and doesn't spread to other areas such as civilian areas. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

Now I'm not trying to be the one to say this from a jealous standpoint because I don't get paid enough from my job. I'm not saying it isn't fair they're paid as much as they are. I'm saying that I think they should be paid a comfortable salary for a nice home and not have to worry about bills and such. But, they shouldn't be paid such gross amounts when that money could be recirculated to help the economy or other critical areas of our nation instead of just hoarding all of it.

Yes, this may sound stupid, but I'd really like some insight as to why sports players deserve the amount of money they're given.

Obviously it should not be 18, because that would give easy access to high school kids. The current drinking age of 21 completely undermines the 20th birthday, the dawn of a new decade, arguably the most important of one's life. Instead of celebrating, most people just simply gloss over their 20th birthdays, just waiting the extra year.

Should we skip our 30th birthdays and wait until 31 for a big celebration? 41 instead of 40? Obviously not. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

-It is a normal event in life for people who are serious about a future and there is no need to celebrate something that is expected and not surprising. 
-I have little emotional connection to the college I am finishing.
-The college is not prestigious/well known for the area I am studying, therefore the coursework was not as vigorous as could be and thereby attending a ceremony that signifies to me little dedication towards studying and finishing my course work is frankly embarrassing.

Many are forced to move from their home towns, face lawsuits from people looking for a quick buck from a deep pocket, and even have a much higher chance of being murdered.

I feel that it should be a person's right to choose whether they want the public to know about their winnings.

I understand that the main dissenting opinion is the idea that this could lead to people believing the whole thing is rigged, and that nobody actually wins the big jackpots. However, it's kind of ridiculous to think that hundreds of millions of dollars in jackpot money just magically disappear without any Lottery employees coming forward. Furthermore, why do we not doubt the legitimacy of other large jackpots? For a long time people have been buying scratch-off tickets without the ridiculous self-identification laws. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Hippie? I believe nomad would be a better term. And, in that case, he was no different than any other nomadic person or tribe. Most wore their hair long (except for proper Roman citizens), and togas or other robes. And sandals were the only footwear available. You are hardly justified in calling Jesus a hippie, much less the first hippie.
And by all accounts, Jesus was a Nazarene.
And Jesus being married is a fallacious assumption.

While the relic is interesting it has little historical significance.  Coronado himself is a rather minor Conquistador and explorer of the New World.  It rightfully belongs to the men who found it and it is their right to do with it whatever they choose.  

Shortly after recovering the Cross,  Dr. Jones meets with Walter Donovan.  He thanks Mr. Donovan for his contributions to the museum and is impressed with his personal collection.  So we know Dr. Jones doesn't feel every historical artifact belongs in a museum for public viewing.  Indiana Jones' obsession with the Cross of Coronado is misguided, and it does not belong in a museum.  CMV.

Sure, Bleach is an enjoyable anime/manga but when you look at anime's the quality is vastly different.
FMA's storyline was set strongly to the 51 episodes, and was never based entirely on the manga. The finite number of episodes is one of its greatest strengths, as storylines that chug on for ages eventually lose steam.
Bleach is now in the 160's if I recall correctly, and a large portion of those are rather daft filler episodes as they try to keep up with the manga that the series is bound to.
The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Be particularly strict and conservative when evaluating. Do not hesitate to assign ""Bad"" if an argument does not clearly meet the criteria for that dimension. The overall quality should reflect a synthesis of the other three dimensions but should also consider any other relevant factors. Do not assume that most arguments are ""Good"". Your priority is to identify weaknesses and be sensitive to any lack of quality. Return your response only as a JSON object using that values (Bad, Good). Do not use other labels.

DO NOT explain. DO NOT comment. DO NOT include any text before or after. ANY output not matching JSON format will be considered INVALID.###DIMENSIONS### 1. **Cogency (Justification Quality)** Evaluate only the justifications used to support the claim. Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### Im Gonna say the Machines, Simply cause it doesent matter which kind of Machine were talking about either terminator or like ""i robot"" they are not easy to kill.

If the Dollar gets low enough in comparison however, Chinese goods will become more expense hurting American consumers in the short term but ultimately strengthening the domestic market for US producers.

If education was forced to have fees the people in poverty would not by able to afford it. This would cripple the poor and put us in a society where only the middle class and rich prosper. (it's bad enough as it is). The people in poverty will never learn how to prevent diseases which plague their society, nor other resources to help them live better lives. As a society we should want to help those who are less fortunate. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Forgive me for saying, but does reaching the arbitrary number of 65 and serving a tougher by nature job entitle you to get a discount at the movies and at a restaurant?  Is it just as a way to say thanks?
Armed forces seem to already get thanks with tax free goods on base.

Senior citizens these days that are retiring are already reaping the benefits of social security, medicare, and hefty retirement funds because the benefits of being in the Baby Boomer generation.

There are many tough professions out there that bring lots of value to the table that are tough but don't get discounts.  What about farmers?  They feed us right?  Doctors?  They keep us healthy.  Scientists?  Their discoveries and innovations improve the quality of our every day lives. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

First of all it's about as entertaining as watching cars drive on the highway. I don't know how anybody who can stand to sit in a stadium for several hours in the sun watching cars drive really fast in circles. How the hell is that entertaining. I'd rather watch a cricket game!

If the teams were both forced to spread across the entire field, everyone has more space, which allows for much more passing, shooting, and generally exciting offensives. I think this would allow for games to be much more higher scoring, therefore making it more exciting and more pleasing for the fans. Hardly any games would end in draws, which in my opinion is the most frustrating thing in any sport. Watching an entire 90 minutes only for neither team to win would almost be ended, or at least greatly reduced. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Single Life(generally speaking)= lonely, a level of immaturity, selfishness, ignorance to making a true commitment, stuck in the memory of the 8th grade class dance!

My point of view..bribing a child is wrong, you have to tell them what you want them to do and expect them to do it...if taught to obey you (thier parent/thier authoirity figure) this should be easy..soemtimes they may not like it...but they are still going to do it ....simply because you told them to. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

Many analysts believe that the US economy is heading for a recession. President Bush went public this week, urging investors not to panic. Political uncertainties in Japan are hitting shares there and many other financial epicentres.
(2)A stream of bad news has been pouring out of the world's corporate headquarters this week. Many companies are reporting their worst results since the recession of the early 1990s. And in some industries, firms have started a round of massive job cuts. These cuts and the continued fall in stocks are slowly destroying consumer confidence and will ultimately lead to recession.

Mac's use generic hardware, not specific apple hardware as is often believed.
People also believe that Mac's breakdown or need to be replaced less often than PCs
If you ever work in an environment (as I have) where Macs are networked together and
used as the primary computer, you will see that Macs are just as perceptible to problems as Pcs.
In fact, we bought a number of Pro machines, which had a 100% failure rate in the 3 or so years they were used. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the holocaust. The piece believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this, put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing l, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are being oil seeking imperialists. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I don't see any benefit in continuing to use this system. However, if 24-hour time became the standard, there could only be positives. It makes more sense numerically, since there's no need for a modifier like ""am"". It should make mental calculations concerning time simpler. It also makes things less confusing for the average person (no accidentally setting your alarm for 7:00PM.)

From what I can gather, the only reason we still use 12-hr clocks is because of tradition and/or refusal to change. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine.

- Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means.

The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.

This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate.

I haven't given this a whole lot of thought, this actually occurred to me only 5 minutes ago. This is too simple to be without flaws, so I'm looking for counterarguments. I am also not
American, so I do not fully understand how your political system works. I hope this doesn't sound too stupid. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Most people survive encountering naked animals, or even animals having sex with little to no issues.  People are basically high functioning animals, and the existence of nude beaches/nudist colonies and swingers clubs/porn shoots is proof that nudity/sex in front of other people is not a danger or harms the non-participating parties in any way.  Since there is no harm, there should be no laws regulating how we choose to clothe ourselves or where we engage in consenting activities, so long as we are legally allowed to be there (i.e. This does not apply to another persons private property, where they would have final say).

Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner.
I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

First, the benefits: no more fights about what marriage is. If you want to get married by your church - you still can. If you want to marry your homosexual partner in a civil ceremony - you can. Government does not care. Instant equality.

Second, this would cut down on bureaucracy. No marriage - no messy divorces. Instant efficiency.

Now to address some anticipated counter points:

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

As for the tax benefits: why should married people get tax deductions?  Sounds pretty unfair to me. If we, as a society want to encourage child rearing - we can do so directly by giving tax breaks to people who have and rare children, not indirectly through marriage.

Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum. 

I don't mean that students should be put in different grades. I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self described liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to better society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a Utopia. These differences in dogma often resorts to divisive politics.

For example, ""Whites, who make up 78 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 35 percent of the state prison population. Blacks, who make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, were 38 percent of the state prison population. Hispanics, who make up 17 percent of the U.S. population, were 21 percent of the state prison population."" Does this mean Blacks or Hispanics should be treated differently just because there are statistically more of them in prison? No. This, I feel, is a good analogy as to why men should be getting the same insurance rates as women.

I'm not a 'masculinist', but It just strikes me as unfair. I would love to hear some other opinions! Thank you for taking the time to read :]

Its legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy.
We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them.

Ask yourself: - Are the justifications believable and relevant to the author's point? - Do they provide enough support for the conclusion? 2. **Effectiveness (Persuasiveness and Presentation)** Assess how persuasive the presentation is. Ask yourself: - Is the author persuasive or credible? - Does the argument evoke emotions appropriately? - Is the language clear, appropriate and grammatically correct? - Is the argument logically ordered and easy to follow? 3. **Reasonableness (Contribution to Issue Resolution)** Consider the argument’s contribution to resolving the issue. Ask: - Would the target audience accept it? - Does it contribute meaningfully to the discussion? - Does it provide helpful information for reaching a conclusion? - Does it address counterarguments? 4. **Overall Quality** Reflect on the three dimensions above. Consider any other relevant factors for the general quality of the argument. ###ARGUMENT### In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.
(The preceding is not my opinion, but instead my rather cynical interpretation of modern society) ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

Having been put through the Illinois Court System, i now know that getting what you want legally is based much more on who you know. Its very much about connections. Connections between Prosecutors and Defense, Prosecutor and Judge, Defense and Judge, etc...
Such is life though. The best way to be successful is to have an advantage over the other guy IMHO. Something that distinguishes you from them. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Bad"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

* Nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring LSD or MDMA. Addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: Definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all.

* Everybody should be able to seek help for addiction without worrying about criminal charges. 

* Everybody should be able to buy govt approved, pure drugs and know what they're taking.

* Everyone knows the war on drugs is a failure. Its fine if you dont think people should be able to do drugs but you cant say your solution is prohibition but I know I guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth.

Squares would not believe how easy it actually is to buy hard drugs. ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"

1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility. 

2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship. 
3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc. 

I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV! ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Good"", ""effectiveness"": ""Good"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Good""}"

I don't like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views is that they are simply female supremacists anymore. However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same.

I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it.

However, that's just my view. Feel free to change it! ###OUTPUT### {""cogency"": ""Bad"", ""effectiveness"": ""Bad"", ""reasonableness"": ""Good"", ""overall"": ""Bad""}"
