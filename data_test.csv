"I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the ""danger"" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies. ",3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.6666666666666665,4.0
"Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing.

"Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is ""evil"".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just ""assisted"" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

"*For the international CMVs the term greek refers to a social component of my university that throws open parties every weekend. Each party has a theme/dress code.*

A lot of people may say that to a certain extent everything is alright in fun and humor, but I believe that organizing parties with dress codes that allow people to dress up as racial stereotypes should be frowned upon and ultimately banned.

By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a ""joke"" to those who attend in attire.

Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.

"We have been watching a CNN special in school about genocides after the holocaust. The piece believes that the US should have intervened in the conflicts. I think that the US was right not to do anything. I don't think it is the responsibility of America to help anyone. I feel like things like this, put the US in a bad position. If we do nothing l, we are viewed as irresponsible because we are a superpower. But if we go in, we look like we are being oil seeking imperialists. So I don't think the US should be fighting other peoples fights. I think that in all of these cases of genocide, it is their responsibility to sort them selves out. Change my view! Thanks to anyone who responds.",3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333
