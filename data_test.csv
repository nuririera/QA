"I am currently a college student at the University of Houston. Three times now I have been threatened with violence less than 2 minutes from my dorm. Once it was diffused by showing a knife. Once I managed to drove off. The final time I was lucky to be saved by campus pd. This has led me to advocate for campus carry. I belive that every college campus should be forced to allow it regardless of what the Dean or students think. The only argument I see against it is the ""danger"" of students carrying , but stats have proven that people with CHL's almost always commit crimes less often than people without liscenses.
Edit: for clarity I'm talking about a law that both allows carry on campuses and forces them to accept it in policies. ",Good,Good,Good,Good
"Increasingly over the last decade the police in America have become more and more aggressive and abusive of their powers. Almost daily we hear of police shooting and killing unarmed and unthreatening citizens along with animals. Most times these cops are given a slap on the wrist or paid leave at worst. I understand that they serve a vital function in our society, but has become evident that they are abusing that trust. In many places they have tried to Institute personally mounted cameras which have been proven to lower incidents and false abuse claims, yet police departments have been adamant against implementation. This leads me to believe that they are trying to hide criminal activity and widespread systemic abuse. If i smoke marijuana I am infinitely more prone to danger from police then from anyone or anything else. And with the increasing militarization this threat is ever increasing. ",Good,Good,Good,Good
"Sadism as the practice of violence or cruelty against others to fulfil some sort of personal or sexual gratification is, in my opinion, the most sickening act a person can commit. In order to commit such an act, the person must be subjugated and therefore weaker than the active participant, thus compounding the act of violence. This is ""evil"".
However where both, or all individuals are consenting active participants, I believe this to be a form of masochism, albeit from the hands of another. Although this statement may seem to be an oxymoron, if you pursue pain and violence, and consequently receive it from the hands of another, is this not just ""assisted"" masochism? (a la assisted suicide) Although these individuals may be strange, what two (or more) consenting adults do in private is no concern of mine.

Cops already doing tests if they suspect you were drinking -- it's not random but probable cause.

Although for those of you who disagree, I wonder just how likely it is that you think photosynthesis evolved. Something as complex as that process occurred by evolution/accident?

"The way i see it, the main controversy comes at whether abortion implies killing another human being or not.

To solve this, we need to define what being alive means legally. I propose that being alive should be measured by brain activity since its our brain what makes us sentient.

So, if a fetus doesn't show any signs of brain activity then its not a living human being yet and could be legally aborted.

This definition bypasses both religious and ethical concerns, potentially makind the abort issue way easier to solve.",Good,Good,Good,Good

"I feel that Kurt Cobain was murdered. Here are my reasons.
1. He had enough heroin in his system to kill an adult 3 times over.
2. The so called suicide note had evidence of being written by two different people. Kurt, himself, and another person.
3. Kurt Cobain's credit card was reported being used after his death.
4. There were no usable fingerprints on the weapon. I mean with all the heroin in his system he would not be coherent enough to put on gloves and then shoot himself.

"Since it's illegal to offer equity in a company via a Kickstarter, what's the point of funding one? It's basically a charitable donation to a for-profit company, or a gamble that you can't win - you'll never receive anything more than you put in, but you are quite likely to receive nothing at all in return for your investment. The only benefit I can see is that if there's some idea out there that was so revolutionary that it could change the world, if only it had the proper funding - but if it was that good, why didn't some big corporation buy it already? So it's probably just snake oil. I really can't see any rational reason to fund a Kickstarter; the only reason I can see to do so is because of an emotional attachment to whatever product is being developed, and a fear that if one does not fund it, the product will never see the light of day.",Good,Bad,Good,Bad

"I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.

* The state's hands are kept clean.

* An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.

* The convicts freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.

* I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.

* If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an ""out"".

* The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.

* No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.",Good,Good,Good,Good

"I'm 30, and it seems like for nearly have my life we have ""at war"" with al qaeda/terrorism by way of military adventurism, nation building, and shifting an enormous amount of GDP into military contractors at the expensive of using that GDP to help our own citizens.

It looks to me that the military industrial complex used 9/11 as an excuse to be at war with a very generic concept of ""terrorism"" so in theory the ""war"" would never end since there will always be ""terrorism"" in the world (pre and post 9/11 dating back 1000's of years...).

It also seems like a political tool of the right wing to scare old white conservatives into fearing brown people so they elect the most hawkish neo-con into office to spend even more on military adventurism.

"By ""white privilege,"" I mean the idea that white people have better off lives than minorities. To me, the assumption that white people live easy, privileged lives is no different from assuming that all black people grew up in the 'hood, join gangs, and are lucky to even graduate high school. Not all African-Americans grow up in poverty, and not all white people have nice lives. There's also this mentality that if a white person is discriminated against (ex:affirmative action,) they somehow ""deserve it"" because of their ""white privilege.""

"I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide.

By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.

They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.

If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

"Recently, I saw a meme about protesters in London pouring concrete over so called ""anti-homeless"" spikes. All of the comments were commending and praising the protesters instead of calling them out on property destruction. More often than not, the goal of a business is to make money, it is not a charity. And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business. So in my opinion, Tesco is just acting in rational self-interest and these protesters are nothing more than common thugs whom should be charged with property destruction and have to pay the costs that they incurred.

If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options.

"I realise that this has been asked before but I'd like to get some fresh thoughts. So I don't really have a definition for greatest and so I guess it's open for interpretation. 

So, the US has the largest GDP in the world (more than double the second place country, China). 
The US donates more money to charity/aid organisations than any other country. 
The US tends to be the entertainment capital of the world (I realise that Bollywood makes more films but I'm just saying over all: quality movies, pop songs, TV shows, video games). 
The US has most of the greatest universities in the world. 

I get that USA has a lot of problems (mass shootings, excessive military spending, political standoffs, &amp;c. ad infinitum). But that being said, for the US to not be the best country another country has to be declared the best.
