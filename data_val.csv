And seeing homeless people near the entrance is enough to turn a lot of people off that would normally enter their business.

If someone gets a divorce from someone, they want nothing to do with that person again, and yet they are forced to continue to hand them their hard worked for money. It's stupid I think.

If a person knows that if they divorce someone, they will have to work out their lifestyle on their own, it would help them really consider their choice and options.

* High turnover of representatives would disrupt the habits that form which serve their interests over the people's, such as proposing the most contentious bills to wring money out of lobbyists

By allowing these parties to go on as a college community, we are furthering the segregation, discrimination, and undermining of our international cultures as they are portrayed as a ""joke"" to those who attend in attire.

Ultimately, by forbidding the use of these themes (in favor of more non racially specific party themes such as black light or tropical) we are protecting the integrity of our international and ethnical students, while very little harm is done on the greek end.

2) Every position can score, and every body type has a position. Therefore, it is more open and enjoyable for everybody, both players and competitors.

"If there was high unemployment in a country, like there is today in most western countries, why would their need to be an influx of more cheap labor? Swelling the ranks of labor when the labor market doesn't grow just creates more competition for fewer jobs, incentivizing employers to hire the employee they can pay the least. Forcing the unemployed and low skilled workers to compete with cheap immigrant labor depresses wages for the lower class. Using skilled immigrant labor for construction, IT, manufacturing, etc. depresses wages for the middle class, which becomes the lower class. There is no need to bring in more labor, and it is done by business with the intent to keep labor cheap. Cheap labor benefits the employer much more than the employee or the consumer, who can afford to spend less on depressed wages. CMV",3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.0,3.333333333333333

The stretching out of events in each episode makes the show feel like its dragging its feet week to week, whereas FMA managed to keep things rolling strongly. Watch other shows like Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann (which had 27 episodes) or Flame of Recca (which had 42) and you can see why a limited number of episodes can add major strength to a series.",4.0,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.0

The inheritance/hospital visitation issues can be handled though contracts (government can even make it much easier to get/sign those forms.) If you could take time to sign up for the marriage licence, you can just as easily sign some contract papers.

If a family suddenly loses their jobs, they can no longer afford to eat or pay rent or buy clothes. Additionally, if outsourcing was removed, prices all around the world would increase dramatically, affecting people currently living on the brink of poverty themselves.

I feel like using privilege in any kind of discussion is just an indirect way of arguing ad hominem, rather than actually engaging the other person in a reasonable debate. Even if someone's opinions really are biased due to their differing experiences caused by social privilege, I don't think that pointing out that privilege is at all a valid way to prove them wrong.",3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333

"- Lobbying is prohibited. 

No one is allowed to influence US politics other than by voting for their preferred candidates. Many countries do not support lobbying, and are absolutely fine.

- Presidential candidates may not, under any circumstances, publicize themselves through monetary means.

The White House will host debates online, and the presidential candidates (all of them, not just the two big ones) will receive an equal amount of publicity through those debates. This way, the smaller candidates aren't automatically out of the question.

This also means that outsiders can't influence who gets voted by donating toward a certain candidate.

It will decide a winner, to be sure.

But the better team doesn't always win. 

And truthfully shoot outs are exciting as anything any other sport can produce but it's a lazy and unfair way to decide a game, especially at the level of the World Cup.

The standard argument is that if 90 minutes in regulation time and 30 more in over time doesn't produce a winner another 30 (or more) won't either.

Why not?

How about removing players from each side as more and more overtime is played or allow more substitutes during OT?

There are many other options that can be used besides shoot outs but everyone seems to be ok with this style of game play.

edit:  By academic I meant something along the lines of 'A recognised subject matter expert with relevant experience' rather than implying only university professors could hold office.",3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665
"Anything we consider art is based on the artist's ability to match something within us that evokes an emotion. Many of the things that we consider beautiful outside of the realm of art (e.g. fractals, algorithms, arguments) are things whose patterns are inherent, or which describe something else in an elegant manner.
I would argue that the part of our mind that experiences beauty does so in reaction to the identification of a pattern, either external or internal to our self.",3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665
"Of course it is. I would compare the situation with the lead up to the Iraq war. There are those in government who are making accusations and then trying to build intelligence around those accusations. What is supposed to be done is to assess the intelligence first and come to your conclusions based on the intelligence.
Israel and the U.S. have a very unhealthy and dysfunctional relationship. We have helped Israel become a nation that relies on terror and violence against opposition instead of balancing strength with diplomacy.
Well if Israel decided to preemptively attack Iran unjustly you can bet there will be blind support from the U.S. government. This revelation should show people how dangerous all our speculative accusations are.",3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665
"Some people may be really bored in their classes because they aren't being challenged. Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum. 

I don't mean that students should be put in different grades. I just feel that if they are not particularly good in one subject, they may need to go to an easier class.",4.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.333333333333333
"Saying you belong to  a political ideology makes you dogmatic. Society is dynamic and can't go by the principles of one political ideology. Political ideologies are secular religions in this regard. Many self described liberals, libertarians, and conservatives rarely listen to each other on how to better society. Liberals see government as the only solution to all of society's ills. Conservatives and Libertarians find government as the mere deterrent to social ills and adhere to free market fundamentalism as holy. It's as if the free market makes everything a Utopia. These differences in dogma often resorts to divisive politics. How is that any different to religious differences? ",3.6666666666666665,4.0,3.0,3.0
"The establishment of Israel is often cited as necessary based on the need to protect people of Jewish heritage from around the world. To the victors go the spoils. Why should an Israeli state be established in a historically relevant but highly dangerous location because of an historical claim that is thousands of years old? Why not annex a portion of Germany, relocate a population whose government actively worked to destroy the Jews, and work towards acceptance of Jewish visitors in their Holy Land? I am very aware that not all Germans were complicit in the actions of the Nazis. However, the annexation of a portion of Germany is arguably more morally justifiable than basically conquering Palestine because of a religion-based claim. If Jewish security is the issue, lopping off a portion of Germany to form Neo-Israel would have been the vastly superior option. CMV.",3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,3.0
"This debate isn't about whether kids should eat candy, but whether governments should ban ads for kids that portray candy-eating as good.
Its legal for kids to eat candy, so why should it be illegal for people to tell kids they should eat it? Besides, kids naturally like sweets and the ads only convince them to choose one brand over another, not to start eating candy.
We need to bring responsibility back to the parents instead of letting them use the government to babysit for them.

"I believe the current situation in North Korea is no laughing matter yet when scrolling through comments on reddit, whenever there is a mention of North Korea, it is almost certain that a joke about it will follow. The jokes mask the reality of the situation and although a small percentage of the people commenting may actually believe in what they're saying, to most, the living conditions, mass executions, labor camps, and the advancement of nuclear technology in North Korea is something we should be aware of and possibly take action to better the situation.

I understand people have a right to joke about whatever they want, after all, they are just jokes. But to me, I find them just as insensitive and inappropriate as joking about the holocaust, other genocides, and injustices to human rights.

"In a society traditionally and, to be honest, still dominated by men, men's general consensus is more popular than women's general consensus, and I think we all know that a lot of men consider lesbians to be downright sexy, because there is no man in the picture to ruin the aesthetic. (Vice versa for gay men.)
Additionally, gay women are more ""socially acceptable,"" for one of the traditional reasons behind homophobia: women are inferior to men.
Gay men are discriminated against because they have no honor: romantic interest in men is for women only, and when an man participates he is ""lowering himself"" to a women's level.
Gay women, on the other hand, are discriminated against less because romantic interest in women is a man's attribute, giving them honor.

"I've long struggled with this and I'd like to here some strong arguments from the other side. I know the benefits of abortion to society, but I can't justify them simply because the net gain is positive - that's opening Pandora's box to me.

For me, just because a human cannot survive on it's own, doesn't mean we shouldn't protect them. Granted, I have absolutely no problem with suicide, so this isn't a religious ""sanctity of life"" issue. I simply believe that since there can be no informed decision made by the fetus, we have an obligation to protect it.

It's an odd issue for me, I want to make abortion legal and easily accessible from a society standpoint, but I can't reach that position due to moral complications. So change my view.",3.333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333
"I'll start off with saying that I am a male myself and I consider myself an egalitarian, a humanitarian and a socialist. I don't like the feminist movement as from what I have personally seen from their views is that they are simply female supremacists anymore. However, from what I have seen is that MRAs are the same.

I agree that there are some gender inequalities that harm the male gender (males being seen as all being pedophiles, women being able to get away with more socially and legally and males' lives being less valued by the media and social justice warriors), however it seems like, like feminists, there are not enough issues to be completely enraged activists about it.

However, that's just my view. Feel free to change it!",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5
