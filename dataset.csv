- dishwashers don't properly dry ""deep"" items like Tupperware and pots, if you aren't careful taking these out, you'll get everything else wet, once again making the process useless.

I think people only ever turn to FAQ pages if rhey can't find what they want within the main site. 

When clients demand an FAQ page, I will challenge this and ask them to rethink what should be in the core copy and what is irrelevant. 

If the information is already within the main content, and they still want an FAQ section, they are just adding unnecessary repetition into the content. 

Websites should Never include an FAQ section and I cant find an argument to support their use other than improving SEO.

It's absurd to me to think that Team A can be passed over for Team B, given identical records and a head-to-head loss, because Team B had an additional goal, with all its attendant factors (only one of which is team strength).

I understand as a union guy that our dues are paltry, and the teamsters and other unions supply a comparatively tiny amount of money to politicians as opposed to corporations. There is already so much undue influence by corporations that I think the ability to fund pro-union politicians would be a fine democratic check to the power of capital. When a politician wants to use legislation to curtail my right to assemble and air my grievances it reminds me of state socialist countries that do the same to their autonomous worker organizations.

The interface has been deisgned with a classic FPS style with only a few additional changes which means you aren't distracted from the game by trying to remember which button to toggle etc.
