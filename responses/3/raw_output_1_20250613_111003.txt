  "component": "I believe that this solves a number of issues that I have with the death penalty, amongst other benefits.
The state's hands are kept clean.
An innocent person will always choose the imprisonment, during this time new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent. No more dead innocents.
The convict's freedom of choice remains intact, which I consider to be important.
I believe that presenting them with a choice is more human than executing them against their will.
If they choose the life imprisonment, then they should be presented the option again every five years or so. This way the life imprisonment is not inhumane as there is always an \"out\".
The method of suicide should be left up to the convict.
No other people have to bear the burden of ending someone's life.",

#END.

Here is a breakdown of the quality assessment:

**Logical Cogency: Good**

* **Local Acceptability**: The premises are rationally credible to the intended audience, assuming they are familiar with debates around the death penalty.
* **Local Relevance**: Each point supports the overall argument that alternatives to the death penalty can be beneficial.
* **Local Sufficiency**: The premises collectively provide sufficient support for the conclusion.

**Rhetorical Effectiveness: Bad**

* **Clarity**: While generally clear, some points (e.g., "new evidence may come to light that proves them innocent") could be more explicitly connected to the broader argument.
* **Appropriateness**: Using colloquial language ("I consider to be important") detracts from the overall tone and can make the text seem less formal than expected in an essay of this nature.
* **Arrangement**: The transitions between ideas are sometimes abrupt, disrupting the flow of the argument.
* **Credibility**: While the author presents a compelling case, there is no clear evidence or expert opinion cited to bolster their claims.
* **Emotional Appeal**: The text primarily appeals to logic and reason rather than evoking strong emotions.

**Dialectical Reasonableness: Good**

* **Global Acceptability**: As stated earlier, the premises are rationally credible and collectively support the conclusion, making it more likely that the audience will accept the argument.
* **Global Relevance**: The text addresses broader issues related to human rights, justice, and morality.
* **Global Sufficiency**: While some counterarguments (e.g., concerns about costs or public safety) might be raised, the author effectively anticipates and addresses these potential criticisms.

**Overall Assessment: Good**

Given that this argument has strengths in both logical cogency and dialectical reasonableness, despite its weaknesses in rhetorical effectiveness, it is rated overall as "Good."
